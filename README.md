Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalizes the data, and addresses class imbalance.

Feature Engineering: Includes insightful features and dimensionality reduction techniques to optimize model performance.

Model Training: Trains multiple models (such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.) and compares their performance.

Evaluation: Uses metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to measure the model's effectiveness.

Deployment Readiness: Prepares the model for integration into a real-time fraud detection system.

Requirements:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Required libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Install dependencies via:
